Apriori Algorithm (raw Python implementation)
Abstract
This lab report presents a clear, self-contained implementation of the Apriori algorithm written in raw Python (no external data-mining libraries). The objective is to discover frequent itemsets and generate association rules from a transactional dataset. The report includes the theoretical background, algorithmic steps, the complete Python implementation, a small example dataset, experiment results (frequent itemsets and association rules), complexity analysis, limitations, and suggestions for improvement. The implementation is designed for reproducibility and assessment.
1. Introduction
Apriori is a classic algorithm in association rule mining used to identify frequent itemsets in a transactional database and to derive association rules from those itemsets. The algorithm uses the Apriori property: all non-empty subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent. Apriori iteratively generates candidate itemsets of increasing size and prunes candidates that contain infrequent subsets.
This lab demonstrates Apriori implemented in plain Python, explains each step, and shows how to tune minimum support and confidence to obtain meaningful rules.
